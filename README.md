Analyzing data with Elasticsearch, and Kibana.

The idea I had for this project was to pull stock data into elasticsearch with a simple python program that would add new stock data into the database every 90 seconds.

By tracking the data I would be able to visualize by seeing the average price over time, how these prices stack up agains the other stocks im tracking.
Also I can place the data of the stocks into a table to quickly have it stored based on any metric I choose. Using the standard deviation of the stock prices I can determine how the stock is currently being valued vs past data.
